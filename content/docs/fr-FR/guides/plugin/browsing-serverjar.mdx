The ~~patcher~~ allows you to more easily prepare an environment for exploring the Hytale Server without publishing the decompiled code.

## Setup

- Clone the patcher `git clone https://github.com/HytaleModding/patcher.git`, and enter the directory. `cd patcher`

- Create a Python virtual environment in the `.venv` folder. The command for this varies by platform but it is probably
  one of these:

  - `python -m venv .venv`
  - `python3 -m venv .venv` (Linux)
  - `py -3.13 -m venv .venv` (Windows)

  In the last one, specifying the version is recommended if you have multiple Pythons installed.

- Activate the virtual environment:
  - Windows: `".venv\Scripts\activate"`  (including the quotes)
  - Linux/Mac: `source .venv/bin/activate`
  - From now on, you are running python commands from inside the venv, hence you must use `python` instead of `py` or `python3` to invoke python.

- Inside the venv, you have to install the dependencies
  - `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Install these dependencies and ensure they are on PATH:
  - `git`
  - `java` you need JDK 25 or newer
  - `jar` (comes with JDK inside the bin folder)
  - `mvn`

## Usage

Put your HytaleServer.jar in the same root directory of this repo or specify an environment variable `HYTALESERVER_JAR_PATH` with the path to your HytaleServer.jar

Then run this:

```shell
python run.py setup
```

It will

- copy the HytaleServer.jar into `work/download`
  - (on Windows) fix `META-INF/license` name collision
- decompile it using Fernflower and save the output to `work/decompile`
- set up a Maven project in `hytale-server` with the decompiled code

You can then open the `hytale-server` folder in your favorite IDE and begin exploring the code. For _IntelliJ IDEA_,
you must first set up the SDK. After opening the project (you can open the `pom.xml` file, IDEA will prompt you to open
the entire project) press Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S and under _Project_ configure SDK and Language level to _25_.

If IDEA does not offer an option to run the main file, right-click the `src` folder -> Mark Directory As -> Sources Root
then reload the maven project:\
![_readme_images/img.png](/assets/reload-maven.png)\
It is located in the "m" icon on the right side:\
![_readme_images/m.png](/assets/maven.png)\
If you don't see it, enable it under View -> Tool Windows -> Maven.\
![_readme_images/tool_windows.png](/assets/view-windowtools-maven.png)

This decompiled code is likely broken. But it is somewhat usable for exploration. Try Ctrl+Shift+F and search PacketAdapters
