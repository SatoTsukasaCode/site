# Introduction

Hynergy is an automation mod for Hytale built around energy systems. It adds a structured way to generate, move, transform, and use energy as part of normal gameplay. Hynergy defines detailed energy behavior that allows systems, and even other mods, to connect and interact in a predictable way.
The mod is made to be intuitive for simple builds and casual players, while still supporting large and advanced setups. It pushes players to think in terms of full systems and overall design, without forcing them to deal with unnecessary or overly technical details. Inspired by real-world engineering ideas, Hynergy translates them into gameplay in a simpler way, aiming to provide a strong foundation for automation in Hytale for both players and mod developers.

# Features

Hynergy introduces multiple interconnected systems built around shared energy rules. The main energy systems are:

- _Electrical_ energy
- _Mechanical_ energy
- _Thermal_ energy
- _Chemical_ energy

In addition, Hynergy includes transportation systems, which handle the movement of substances and energy carriers:

- _Fluid transportation_ systems
- _Item transportation_ systems

Each system includes its own blocks and machines made to work with that type of energy. Players can adjust how these systems behave, changing things like speed, strength, or output, making it easier to control machines and build smoother, more efficient automation setups.

# Energy Systems

- **Electricity**: Used for precise control, logic, signals, and advanced automation. Ideal for managing systems, regulating machines, and building complex control setups.
- **Mechanics**: Based on rotation, shafts, and gears. Great for early power generation and simple, reliable automation driven by moving parts.
- **Fluids**: Uses pipes and flow-based systems to transport fluids that can carry energy, pressure, or heat, and interact with other energy systems through conversion blocks.
- **Thermal**: Focused on heat generation and transfer. Used for processing, efficiency improvements, and machines that depend on temperature.
- **Chemical**: Uses fuels and reactions to store and release energy, often providing dense or portable energy sources.
- **Transportation**: Move items or fluids that carry embedded energy. They do not produce energy on their own, but allow energy to be transported, stored, and converted between systems.

# Gameplay and Progression

- **Zone 1**: The game starts with basic mechanical power.
  Players use simple shafts, gears, hand-driven mechanisms, gravity, and water wheels to generate and transmit energy. This zone focuses on understanding movement, rotation, and how machines connect into a working system.
- **Zone 2**: Electrical systems are introduced, adding control and precision. Players unlock cables, junctions, basic electronics, logic components, and windmills for power generation. Electricity allows machines to be switched, regulated, and automated more reliably, often working together with mechanical systems.
- **Zone 3**: Fluid transportation systems become available. Pipes, pumps, pressure, and fluid-based machines allow energy and resources to be moved across larger setups. Fluids start playing a key role in energy conversion and advanced processing.
- **Zone 4**: Thermal systems take center stage. Heat, steam, and high-temperature machines provide powerful late-game energy and processing options. This zone focuses on combining all previous systems into large, efficient automation networks.

## Stage one

Stage 1 represents the first release of Hynergy and focuses on core mechanical and electrical systems. It introduces the essential blocks needed to generate, transmit, and use energy, including basic mechanical components, early generators and simple cables. This stage is designed to establish the core energy behavior of the mod, teaching how systems connect, react to load, and scale, and laying the groundwork for all future updates.
