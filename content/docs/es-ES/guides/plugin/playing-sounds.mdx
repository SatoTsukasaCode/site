In this guide, you will learn how to play sounds to a player.

## Sound Indexes

We currently have a lot of Sounds available to be used as a key in the AssetMap, [click here](../../server/sounds) to see the full list of available sounds.

You can use the `getAssetMap()` method from the `SoundEvent` class to get the index of a specified sound:

```java
int index = SoundEvent.getAssetMap().getIndex("SFX_Cactus_Large_Hit");
```

## The Transform Component

The `TransformComponent` is the component that tells Hytale where to play the sound. You can get this in multiple ways.

1. Getting the Transform Component from the `Player` object

```java
TransformComponent transform = store.getComponent(context.senderAsPlayerRef(), EntityModule.get().getTransformComponentType());
```

2. Generating a new TransformComponent (although this is not recommended, as if your player is not close enough they won't hear the sound)

```java
Vector3d vector3d = new Vector3d(0, 0, 0); // position
Vector3f vector3f = new Vector3f(0, 0, 0); // rotation
TransformComponent transform = new TransformComponent(vector3d, vector3f);
```

### PlayerRef

You need a Player Reference, which is a instance of `Ref<EntityStore>`. If you have the `Player` object, you can use the `getReference()` method to get a Player Reference

### World

You need a World reference, as the sound needs to be played inside the `execute()` method from the `World` class.

### SoundCategory

There is a `SoundCategory` enum that defines different sound categories, such as `Music`, `Ambient`, `SFX` and `UI`. You can use these categories to specify the type of sound you are playing.

## Playing Sounds

You can use the `SoundUtil` class to play sounds, using the `playSoundEvent3dToPlayer` method.

```java
int index = SoundEvent.getAssetMap().getIndex("SFX_Cactus_Large_Hit");
World world = player.getWorld();
EntityStore store = world.getEntityStore();
Ref<EntityStore> playerRef = player.getReference();
world.execute(() -> {
    TransformComponent transform = store.getStore().getComponent(playerRef, EntityModule.get().getTransformComponentType());
    SoundUtil.playSoundEvent3dToPlayer(playerRef, index, SoundCategory.UI, transform.getPosition(), store.getStore());
});
```
