Nesta página, responderemos algumas perguntas frequentes.

## 1. O cliente pode ser modificado?

Não, não pode ser modificado. No entanto, ele não terá controle sobre a aparência do jogo e da interface do usuário.

The server decides the visuals, more like the "Resource Packs" available in Minecraft. The server decides what mods are used

## 2. Qual protocolo de rede será usado?

Hytale will use the QUIC transport protocol.

For context, the two main Internet protocols are UDP and TCP.

* UDP is connectionless, fast, fire-and-forget packets but has less reliability as packets can be lost.
* TCP is connection-based, slower than UDP, can guarantee packet delivery with much more reliability.
  Both are pretty fast in modern times, games can run fine on both (but generally prefer UDP).

QUIC is a **hybrid protocol** that builds off UDP to get the same speed benefits, but adds some layers of reliability like TCP.
Essentially, a solid choice for game development that blends speed and reliability.

## 3. O que são os pacotes de transferência?

Transfer packets in Hytale are small data payloads *(4kb)* that allow players to move from one server to another while carrying information.
They are not equivalent to something like BungeeCord or Velocity and are primarily intended for smaller servers.

Unlike BungeeCord, they do not manage network-wide features such as global plugins.
Implementing DDOS protection would also be incredibly hard for smaller networks by using transfer packets.

Transfer packets work quite well in scenarios such as small server networks or hubs where players will hop between servers without the loss of progress. For example, a player might finish a dungeon on one server and then move to a lobby or different game mode with their inventory and stats intact. This lessens server costs and enables the developers to put more effort into gameplay improvement rather than complicated network setups.

## 4. O Hytale suportará servidores dedicados?

Yes, Hytale will support dedicated servers. This allows server owners to host their own Hytale servers on their own hardware or through third-party hosting services.

Dedicated servers provide more control over server settings, mods, and performance compared to using official hosting solutions.

## 5. O Hytale suportará as modificações em consoles?

No momento, as modificações para o Hytale estão focadas para a plataforma de PC.
