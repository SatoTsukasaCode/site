## The Basics

Hytale servers don't receive raw keyboard input. The client interprets keypresses and sends packets describing what action the player wants to perform. You need to intercept these packets or events to create custom behavior.

## Custom Keybinds

Some packets are interceptable and can be used to trigger your own use-cases. This section will link to detailed guides on all interception methods as they become documented.

## Limitations

**Cannot do:**
- Add new keybinds (client-side)
- Detect keys that don't send packets (Escape for example)

**Can do:**
- Intercept existing interaction types and redirect them
- Listen for mouse events
- Repurpose unused slots (like hotbar slot 9)

## Mouse Events

For mouse input, use the event system instead of packet interception:

```java
getEventRegistry().register(PlayerMouseButtonEvent.class, event -> {
    MouseButtonEvent mouse = event.getMouseButton();

    if (mouse.mouseButtonType == MouseButtonType.Left
            && mouse.state == MouseButtonState.Pressed) {

        Entity target = event.getTargetEntity();
        Vector3i block = event.getTargetBlock();
        Item item = event.getItemInHand();

        // Cancel the click
        // event.setCancelled(true);
    }
});
```

### Mouse Button Types

```java
MouseButtonType.Left
MouseButtonType.Middle
MouseButtonType.Right
MouseButtonType.X1
MouseButtonType.X2
```

### Mouse Button States

```java
MouseButtonState.Pressed
MouseButtonState.Released
```

### Double-Click Detection

The `clicks` field tracks consecutive clicks:

```java
if (mouse.clicks >= 2) {
    // Double-clicked
}
```

## Available Player Events

| `PlayerConnectEvent` | Player connecting |
| `PlayerDisconnectEvent` | Player disconnecting |
| `PlayerReadyEvent` | Player fully loaded |

| `PlayerInteractEvent` | Interaction with world/entities |
| `PlayerMouseButtonEvent` | Mouse button press/release |
| `PlayerMouseMotionEvent` | Mouse movement |
| `PlayerCraftEvent` | Item crafted |
| `AddPlayerToWorldEvent` | Player added to world |
| `DrainPlayerFromWorldEvent` | Player removed from world |
