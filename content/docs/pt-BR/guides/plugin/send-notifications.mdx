## Overview

In this guide, you will learn how to send notifications to players, similar to
the notification received when picking up an item from the ground.

## Structure of a Notification

A notification consists of three main components:

1. **Primary Message**: The main `Message` displayed in the notification.
2. **Secondary Message**: Additional `Message`, displayed below the primary message.
3. **Icon**: An item icon that visually represents the notification, shown on
   the left side.

## Sending Notifications

You can use the `NotificationUtil` class to send notifications to players.
You will need access to the `PacketHandler` of the player, which can be obtained
from the `PlayerRef` using the `getPacketHandler()` method (in this example,
we get the `PlayerRef` from the `Universe` using the player's UUID).

```java
public static void onPlayerReady(PlayerReadyEvent event) {
    var player = event.getPlayer();

    var playerRef = Universe.get().getPlayer(player.getUuid());
    var packetHandler = playerRef.getPacketHandler();

    var primaryMessage = Message.raw("THIS WORKS!!!").color("#00FF00");
    var secondaryMessage = Message.raw("This is the secondary message").color("#228B22");
    var icon = new ItemStack("Weapon_Sword_Mithril", 1).toPacket();

    NotificationUtil.sendNotification(
        packetHandler,
        primaryMessage,
        secondaryMessage,
        (ItemWithAllMetadata) icon);
}
```
